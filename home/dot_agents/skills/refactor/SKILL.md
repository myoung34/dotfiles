# Refactor

Strategic refactoring skill. Investigates a feature in the current
codebase, identifies complexity and fragmentation, and produces a
reimplementation plan answering: "Knowing what we know now, if we started
from scratch, how would we do this differently?"

## Input

The argument follows the skill invocation. If empty, prompt:

```txt
What feature or area do you want to refactor?
```

Parse the response into a short kebab-case slug (e.g. `auth-middleware`,
`config-loading`) for use in file names.

## Gather project metadata

Load [`git-metadata/SKILL.md`](../git-metadata/SKILL.md) and run its
commands. Include the output in the subagent prompt as context so it can
prioritize empirically.

## Investigation Phase

Spawn a single subagent (exploration / investigation role) on the cheapest
model tier adequate to the investigation (see
[`../shared/SUBAGENT-STEERABILITY.md`](../shared/SUBAGENT-STEERABILITY.md)).
Its prompt must include:

- The feature or area to investigate.
- The current working directory.
- The **project metadata** gathered above — instruct the subagent to use
  it to prioritize which code to investigate first and to corroborate
  findings against the empirical data.
- The investigation checklist below (verbatim).
- The **code-judo brief** (verbatim) from
  [`../shared/CODE-JUDO.md`](../shared/CODE-JUDO.md) — push the subagent
  toward deletions, not just rearrangements, scoped to this single
  feature.
- Instructions to use file reading, search, and any relevant language
  tools available.

### Investigation checklist

Include this verbatim in the subagent prompt:

> You are a principal engineer performing a strategic code review. Your
> goal is to deeply understand a feature's implementation and answer: "If
> we were to reimplement this from scratch, what would we do
> differently?"
>
> **Map the implementation:**
>
> - Identify all files, functions, types, and interfaces involved
> - Trace the data flow and control flow end-to-end
> - Document the public API surface and internal boundaries
> - Note which packages/modules own which responsibilities
>
> **Identify complexity hotspots:**
>
> - Functions longer than 50 lines that do multiple things
> - Deep nesting (>3 levels)
> - High cyclomatic complexity
> - Complex conditionals or switch statements
> - Functions with many parameters (>4)
>
> **Identify fragmentation:**
>
> - Logic for the same concern scattered across multiple packages
> - Duplicated patterns that should be unified
> - Inconsistent abstractions (same concept modeled differently in
>   different places) — cite the peer `file:line` establishing each
>   pattern you claim is departed from
> - Leaky abstractions where internals bleed across boundaries
> - Orphaned helpers or utilities that belong closer to their callers
>
> **Identify coupling issues:**
>
> - Circular or upward dependencies between packages
> - Concrete types used where interfaces would decouple
> - Shared mutable state or global variables
> - Tight coupling to external services without abstraction
>
> **Identify missing prerequisites:**
>
> - What interfaces, shared types, or abstractions should have existed
>   before this feature was built?
> - What test infrastructure (helpers, fixtures, fakes) is missing?
> - What documentation or architectural decisions should have been made
>   first?
>
> **Structure your report as:**
>
> 1. **Implementation map** — files, types, and data flow
> 1. **Complexity hotspots** — ranked by severity
> 1. **Fragmentation issues** — ranked by impact
> 1. **Coupling issues** — ranked by risk
> 1. **Missing prerequisites** — what should have existed first
> 1. **Key insight** — the single biggest deletion opportunity: the one
>    change that makes the most complexity vanish

## Analysis

Synthesize the findings into a coherent reimplementation strategy. Focus
on:

- The root causes of complexity, not just symptoms.
- What the ideal decomposition looks like.
- What order to build things in (prerequisites first).
- What to preserve vs. what to rewrite.

## Plan Output

Emit the plan using the shared skeleton in
[`../shared/REIMPL-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`](../shared/REIMPL-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md).
Substitute:

- `{Plan Type}` → `Refactor`
- `{Scope Name}` → the feature name
- `{plan-type}` → `refactor`
- `{slug}` → the feature slug

`refactor` adds no extra sections — leave every insertion-point anchor
empty. The shared file also carries the output path and the plan-writing
guidelines.

## Surface durable rules

Load [`durable-rules/SKILL.md`](../durable-rules/SKILL.md) and follow its
process.

## Agent teams (if your harness supports it)

Run the investigation agent as a teammate in parallel rather than inline,
then build the plan from its report. See
[`shared/AGENT-TEAMS.md`](../shared/AGENT-TEAMS.md) for enablement
instructions.
