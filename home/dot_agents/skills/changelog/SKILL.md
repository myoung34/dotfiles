# Changelog

Generate a [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) entry
in the project's `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Context

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Status: !`git status --short`
- Working diffstat: !`git diff --stat HEAD 2>/dev/null`
- Branch vs main diffstat: !`git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null)...HEAD 2>/dev/null`
- Branch commits: !`git log --oneline $(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null)..HEAD 2>/dev/null`
- Today: !`date +%Y-%m-%d`

## Process

1. **Pick the change source.**

   - If the working tree has uncommitted changes (staged or unstaged), use
     `git diff HEAD` as the source of truth.
   - Otherwise diff the branch against `main` (or `master` if main is absent):
     `git diff $(git merge-base HEAD <base>)...HEAD`. Also read `git log` on the
     branch for commit-message hints.
   - If both are empty, stop and tell the user there's nothing to record.

1. **Read the full diff** of the chosen source — categorisation needs the actual
   hunks, not the diffstat.

1. **Locate `CHANGELOG.md`** at the repo root.

   - If absent, **create it** using the Template before adding the new entry.
     Start version history at `0.0.1` unless the user specifies otherwise, or
     tags / `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / similar suggest a different starting
     version.
   - If present, read it to match existing style (heading depth, version scheme,
     per-package sub-section headings, en-dash vs hyphen in date).

1. **Determine the version.**

   - Increment the most recent version heading per SemVer:
     - `Fixed`-only → patch bump
     - `Added` / `Changed` (non-breaking) → minor bump
     - Breaking `Changed` / `Removed` → major bump
   - If the project is pre-1.0 (`0.x.y`), bump the patch for everything unless
     the user says otherwise.
   - If unsure, prompt the user.

1. **Categorise changes** under Keep a Changelog sections, in this order,
   omitting empty ones:

   - `Added` — new features
   - `Changed` — changes to existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` — soon-to-be-removed features
   - `Removed` — now-removed features
   - `Fixed` — bug fixes
   - `Security` — vulnerability fixes

1. **Write entries:**

   - One bullet per logical change, not per file.
   - Lead with the affected package/module/file when the project organises that
     way (match existing entries).
   - State what changed and, where non-obvious, why.
   - Wrap lines at ~80 chars, continuation lines indented two spaces.
   - Use backticks for identifiers, paths, env vars, flags.

1. **Insert** the new version block directly below the preamble and above the
   previous most-recent version. Use today's date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

1. **Show the diff** of `CHANGELOG.md` to the user. Do not commit.

## Template

When creating a new `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- ...
```

## Style notes

- Omit needless words — see
  [`../shared/CONCISE-PROSE.md`](../shared/CONCISE-PROSE.md). One line per entry;
  lead with the change.
- Match the existing changelog's punctuation (em-dash `—` vs hyphen `-` between
  version and date) exactly. Don't normalise.
- Don't include commit hashes, PR numbers, or author names unless the existing
  changelog already does.
- Don't describe internal refactors with no observable effect unless the
  changelog already records them.
- Don't add a `[Unreleased]` section unless the project already uses one.
