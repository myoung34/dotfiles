# Redesign

Codebase-wide redesign audit. Wider than `refactor` (single feature), not a
diff review (`code-review`), not AI-slop cleanup (`cleanup`). Reviews the
*current state* and asks: **knowing what we know now, if we started over, how
would we do this differently — and what could we delete entirely?**

## Input

Detect scope from the argument and parse it into a kebab-case slug for the
output filename:

| Argument            | Scope                             | Slug         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| None                | Whole codebase                    | `codebase`   |
| Subsystem name/path | Scoped audit (e.g. `api`, `auth`) | kebab of arg |

## Gather project metadata

Load [`git-metadata/SKILL.md`](../git-metadata/SKILL.md), run its commands, and
include the output in every subagent prompt so each can prioritize empirically.

## Detect language

Detect the primary language before spawning subagents and pass the result to
each (it gates checks, and tells the Standards subagent whether to read the
user's Go conventions):

- Go — `go.mod` at repo root
- TypeScript/JavaScript — `package.json` with `typescript`, or `.ts` files
- Other — file-extension heuristics

## Spawn four parallel subagents

Spawn all four in a single message with parallel tool calls. All four are the
platform's `general-purpose` (workhorse) role, on the cheapest model tier
adequate to the audit (see
[`../shared/SUBAGENT-STEERABILITY.md`](../shared/SUBAGENT-STEERABILITY.md)). Each
prompt must include the
project metadata, the detected language, the in-scope file list, and the
instruction: review-only; do not modify code or run tools that change state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every subagent reports findings only — **none of them edit code.**

### Subagent 1: Aspirational structure

Soul of the skill: push for restructurings that *delete* whole categories of
complexity, not rearrange them. Include the code-judo brief from
[`../shared/CODE-JUDO.md`](../shared/CODE-JUDO.md) verbatim in the prompt, then
the triggers and remedies below.

#### Concrete triggers to scan for

Flag only these specific, measurable signals — no fuzzy "looks off" findings:

- **File >1000 lines** — propose a decomposition.
- **Function >50 lines doing multiple things** — propose extraction.
- **Wrapper / identity functions** — forward arguments to another call without
  adding validation, defaulting, or transformation.
- **Loose type boundaries** — values typed as the language's escape hatch
  (`any`/`interface{}` in Go, `any`/`unknown` in TypeScript, `Object` in
  Java/C#, dynamic dispatch in Python) immediately narrowed via type assertion
  or runtime check — a missing typed boundary.
- **Feature flags scattered across >1 file** — feature conditionals bolted into
  shared paths instead of behind a dedicated abstraction.
- **Near-duplicate helpers** where a canonical utility already exists.
- **Switch/if chains with >5 arms over the same discriminant** — missing
  dispatch table, polymorphic type, or state machine.
- **Sequential `await` / `go func()` chains over independent work units** —
  unnecessary serialization that parallelism would also simplify.
- **Thin abstractions / pass-through helpers** that add indirection without
  buying clarity.
- **Logic in the wrong layer** — feature logic in shared utilities, or storage
  details bleeding into handlers.
- **Non-atomic sequences** — related state updates that can leave the system
  half-applied when a more atomic structure is obvious.

#### Preferred remedies

Bias toward:

- Delete a layer of indirection rather than polishing it.
- Reframe the state model so conditionals disappear instead of centralizing.
- Change the ownership boundary so the feature becomes a natural extension of an
  existing abstraction.
- Turn special-case logic into a simpler default flow with fewer exceptions.
- Replace condition chains with a typed model or explicit dispatcher.
- Collapse duplicate branches into a single clearer flow.
- Reuse the canonical helper instead of a near-duplicate.
- Move logic to the package/module/layer that owns the concept.
- Parallelize independent work when that also simplifies orchestration.
- Restructure related updates into a more atomic flow.

Do not settle for "maybe rename this" when the issue is structural, nor for a
cleaner version of the same messy idea when a much simpler idea is plausible.

#### Report shape

Group by severity. Each finding: file + approximate line range, the specific
trigger that fired, why it matters (impact, not aesthetics), concrete remedy
(delete X, reframe Y, extract Z).

### Subagent 2: Standards drift

Maps where the code has drifted from its own documented conventions.

#### Standards sources

Collect these paths before spawning, pass the list to the subagent:

- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` at root and in subdirectories
- `STYLE.md`, `STANDARDS.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md` at root or under `docs/`
- `docs/adr/**/*.md` — ADRs are standards
- Per-package `README.md` files that document conventions
- `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc.*`, `biome.json`, `prettier.config.*`,
  `tsconfig.json` — machine-enforced; the subagent skips what tooling covers

**For Go projects** (`go.mod` present), also include the user's canonical Go
conventions — authoritative for Go audits (naming, error wrapping, layer
separation `handlers -> service -> repository`, observability, constructors,
stdlib preferences like `net/netip` over `net`, `http.MethodGet` over `"GET"`).
Do not include them for non-Go audits:

- `~/.claude/rules/go.md`
- `~/.agents/skills/conventions-go/SKILL.md`

#### Subagent brief

> Read all standards sources first. Then scan the codebase. Report places where
> the code violates a documented standard. For each finding cite the standard
> (file path + the rule). Distinguish hard violations (clear rule + clear
> breach) from judgement calls. Skip anything machine-enforced tooling already
> covers — focus on what humans must catch.

### Subagent 3: Purpose drift

Maps where the code has drifted from its stated purpose.

#### Purpose sources

- Top-level `README.md`
- Per-package / per-module `README.md` files
- `docs/**/*.md` — especially anything matching PRD/spec/design
- `package.json` description, `go.mod` module path, `Cargo.toml` description,
  etc.

If the scope has no purpose docs at all, this subagent reports "no purpose docs
found" and is skipped in the synthesis.

#### Subagent brief

> Read the stated-purpose docs first. Then read the code. Report:
>
> 1. **Vestigial features** — documented as core but the code looks abandoned,
>    has no recent commits, or no callers.
> 1. **Scope creep** — significant code with no stated purpose in any doc.
>    Unsanctioned features, dead-end experiments, or undocumented expansion.
> 1. **Doc/code divergence** — what the docs say vs. what the code does.
>
> Quote the doc line for each finding.

### Subagent 4: Test coverage audit

A redesign without a behavioral safety net is rewriting from memory. Map what is
*currently protected by tests* so the synthesis can flag undertested targets.

#### Sources

- All test files (`*_test.go`, `*.test.ts`, `tests/**`, `__tests__/**` —
  language-aware)
- Coverage reports if present (`coverage.out`, `lcov.info`, `coverage.xml`)
- CI config (`.github/workflows/**`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Makefile`) to identify
  which test suites actually run

#### Subagent brief

> Map the codebase's behavioral coverage. Do not judge test *quality* unless
> egregious (e.g. tests that assert nothing). The goal is a coverage map, not a
> test review.
>
> For each major boundary (public API, package boundary, integration point),
> report:
>
> - Behaviors covered by tests — cite test names + files
> - Public APIs with NO tests
> - Untested error paths
> - Untested concurrency / lifecycle behaviors
> - Integration points with no end-to-end coverage
>
> Tag each finding with the boundary it concerns so the synthesis can
> cross-reference it against redesign targets.

## Synthesis

After all four return, synthesize a coherent redesign strategy:

- **Cross-axis priority** — findings on multiple axes go to the top. An
  aspirational restructure that also resolves a standards violation and a
  purpose drift is highest priority.
- **Delete over rearrange** — prefer findings that *delete* complexity.
- **Root cause, not symptom** — name the underlying design issue.
- **Coverage cross-reference** — for every restructure target, check Subagent
  4's coverage map. If the boundary lacks tests, tag the task
  `BLOCKED-ON-TESTS` and list the specific pinning tests it needs.

This is a soft gate: the plan is still produced. The user may proceed in
coverage-light areas, but the risk is explicit.

### Tension with "no code without a failing test"

If the user's `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent) says *no code without a failing
test*, the Phase 0 characterization tests are the **documented exception**: they
pass by construction, pinning existing behavior so the redesign cannot silently
change it. The output plan must note this exception explicitly so a downstream
agent doesn't mechanically reject Phase 0.

## Output

Emit the plan using the shared skeleton in
[`../shared/REIMPL-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`](../shared/REIMPL-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md).
Substitute:

- `{Plan Type}` → `Redesign`
- `{Scope Name}` → the scope name (subsystem or `codebase`)
- `{plan-type}` → `redesign`
- `{slug}` → the scope slug

`redesign` is more demanding than `refactor`, so it fills the template's
insertion-point anchors and overrides one phase:

**`extra metadata bullets`** — add:

```markdown
- **Scope**: codebase | <subsystem path>
```

**`findings / analysis sections`** (between Current State and What We Should
Have Done First) — add:

```markdown
## Findings

### Aspirational Structure

{Subagent 1's findings, grouped by severity. Each entry: file:line, the
trigger that fired, impact, concrete remedy.}

### Standards Drift

{Subagent 2's findings. Each entry cites the standard (file + rule).}

### Purpose Drift

{Subagent 3's findings. Each entry quotes the doc line.}

### Test Coverage

{Subagent 4's coverage map, focused on boundaries the redesign touches.}

## Cross-Cutting Wins

{Findings that resolve multiple axes — these go first.}

## Behavioral Invariants

{Explicit list of behaviors the redesign must preserve, derived from
purpose docs and existing tests. This is the post-redesign verification
target.}
```

**`pre-prerequisite phases`** (before Phase 1, inside Reimplementation Tasks) —
add the Phase 0 callout and phase:

````markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phase 0 contains characterization tests that pin existing behavior.
> These tests **pass by construction** — this is the documented exception
> to the "no code without a failing test" rule. No Phase 1+ task targeting
> a boundary may proceed before its Phase 0 pinning tests land.

### Phase 0: Test Pinning

- [ ] **Task 0.1**: Pin {boundary X} with characterization tests.

  {What behaviors to capture. Test file path. Reference the public API
  and error paths from the coverage audit.}

  ```{language}
  // Example pinning test signature
  ```
````

Phase 2 tasks should cite their pinning: `Pinned by: Phase 0 tasks {0.x, 0.y}.`
— or, if the boundary still lacks coverage, `BLOCKED-ON-TESTS: needs {specific missing tests}.`

**Phase N: Verification** — override the template's generic verification tasks
with:

```markdown
### Phase N: Verification

- [ ] **Task N.1**: Run all Phase 0 pinning tests — must still pass.
- [ ] **Task N.2**: Confirm every behavioral invariant from the section
  above still holds.
- [ ] **Task N.3**: Verify complexity reduction — file/function size
  metrics, layer-leak count, branching count.
```

**`trailing sections`** (after File Changes) — add:

```markdown
## Approval Bar

This plan treats the following as presumptive blockers — if any survive
into the implementation, justify them explicitly:

- A code-judo move that would delete incidental complexity is left on
  the table.
- A file >1000 lines is preserved or made larger without strong reason.
- Feature logic remains scattered across shared modules.
- Unnecessary abstractions, wrappers, or escape-hatch-typed contracts
  remain.
- A near-duplicate of an existing canonical helper is kept.
```

In `Notes & Caveats`, also list any tasks tagged `BLOCKED-ON-TESTS`.

## Surface durable rules

Load [`durable-rules/SKILL.md`](../durable-rules/SKILL.md) and follow its
process.

## Additional guidelines

The shared template carries the base plan-writing guidelines. For redesign,
also: be direct and demanding about quality. Do not soften major
maintainability issues into mild suggestions. If the implementation missed a
dramatic simplification, say so clearly.

## Non-goals

- Does not edit code. (See `cleanup`.)
- Does not review diffs. (See `code-review`.)
- Does not investigate a single feature. (See `refactor`.)
- Does not approve or block PRs — output is a plan, not a verdict.

## References

- Peer skills: `refactor` (single-feature investigation), `cleanup` (AI-slop
  fixes), `code-review` (multi-axis diff review).
