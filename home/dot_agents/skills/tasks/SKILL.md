# Tasks

You already walked the code path while planning this session. `/tasks` writes
that walk down as a task list a cheaper model can *retrace* mechanically —
without re-reading the codebase, exploring, or making a design decision. This is
the prewalk trade: pay for exploration once, hand the executor the result.

The output is a self-executing document under `docs/tasks/`. Producing it and
running it are separate steps — see [Hand-off](#hand-off).

## Precondition

This is not a planning skill; it crystallizes a plan that already exists and
never invents one. If no plan is in context and none is on disk, stop and point
the user at [`project-plan`](../project-plan/SKILL.md) or
[`architect`](../architect/SKILL.md).

## Input

Take the plan from the first source that exists, in order:

1. The planning worked out in the current conversation — the primary source.
1. A plan or research doc named by the user, or under `docs/plans/` and
   `docs/research/` — fold its detail in.
1. Neither — stop (see Precondition).

A whole plan need not become one document. Pass a single slice as the scope to
crystallize it alone — when one task doc would be unwieldy, or you want to
execute early slices before finalizing later ones.

Do not re-derive what the session already settled. Verify specific references
with tools; never re-explore settled ground.

## Pull request delivery

After decomposing the work into tasks, determine how it should be delivered
using
[`PULL-REQUEST-DELIVERY.md`](../shared/PULL-REQUEST-DELIVERY.md).

Use a confirmed `Pull Request Delivery` mapping from the source plan when one
exists. Otherwise assess the tasks directly. When the guide recommends a stack,
show the proposed task-to-layer grouping and wait for the user to accept,
change, or decline it before writing the document.

Absence of a project plan or delivery mapping never implies a single PR. A
stack layer may contain any number of related tasks.

### Language

Auto-detect the primary language from the files the plan touches; proceed unless
the user corrects you. If Go, load [`conventions-go`](../conventions-go/SKILL.md)
before emitting any Go so embedded code follows the style guide.

## The bar

Every task must clear this bar: **a low-capability agent, given only this
document and a shell, can complete it — writing no code of its own invention,
making no design decision, opening no file not named here.** A task that needs a
judgment call, a lookup, or absent context has not cleared it; supply what is
missing or split the task until each piece does.

The passing test is the contract, not the pasted code: if the provided
implementation does not turn the test green, the executor fixes the code, never
the test. This rule ships inside the document — see `TEMPLATE.md`.

## Task anatomy

Order tasks so each is executable once all prior tasks are done; the executor
works top to bottom. Each task carries:

- **Location** — exact path(s), with line anchors when editing existing code.
- **Test (red)** — the failing test verbatim, where it goes, the command that
  runs it, and the failure to expect.
- **Implementation (green)** — the code that passes the test, verbatim, and
  where it goes.
- **Verify** — a runnable check with its expected output: usually the test
  going green; otherwise a build, `grep`, or lint result.

Not every task is code. A dependency add or a config wire has no test — give it
a `Verify` that is still a runnable check (build succeeds, `grep` matches).

## Write the document

Write to `docs/tasks/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<slug>.md` (date from `date +%F`, author from
`git config user.name`), `Status: Ready`. Follow the scaffold and worked example
in [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md): an execution protocol the executor follows, a
"Context for the executor" section serializing the exploration (goal, existing
signatures, paths, conventions, and gotchas the tasks depend on), the confirmed
pull request delivery mapping, then the ordered tasks.

## Guidelines

- Exact references only — real signatures, types, import paths, not pseudocode.
  Cite each as `path/to/file.go:42`; before finalizing, confirm every cited
  symbol still resolves, and that every symbol a task invents is spelled
  identically in every later task that uses it.
- Keep the "Context" prose tight — see
  [`../shared/CONCISE-PROSE.md`](../shared/CONCISE-PROSE.md) and
  [`conventions-markdown`](../conventions-markdown/SKILL.md).

## Hand-off

`/tasks` stops at the document. To run it, point a fresh agent at the path —
[`delegate`](../delegate/SKILL.md), [`next-task`](../next-task/SKILL.md), or a
subagent on a cheap model. The document is self-contained; the executor needs
nothing but the file.
