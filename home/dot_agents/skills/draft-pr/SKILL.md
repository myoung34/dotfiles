# Draft PR

Open a pull request whose description is direct and concise, structured around a
clear **Problem** and **Solution**.

## Context

If the fields below show commands rather than output, run each one first.

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "(not a git repo)"`
- Default branch: !`git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "(unknown — detect in step 2)"`
- Status: !`git status --short 2>/dev/null`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -15 2>/dev/null`
- Existing PR: !`gh pr view --json url,state,isDraft 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"`

## Process

1. **Check for a stack.** Read the active plan or task document, then run
   `gh stack view --json`. If the document declares `Stack` or the command
   finds an active stack, invoke [`stacked-prs`](../stacked-prs/SKILL.md) and
   stop. `gh stack submit` creates or updates the complete PR chain and its
   base branches.

1. **Check preconditions.**

   - Not a git repo, or branch is the base branch itself → stop and say so. A PR
     needs a feature branch distinct from base.
   - If an open PR already exists for this branch, stop and ask whether to
     update its description instead of opening a new one.

1. **Determine the base branch.** Use the default branch from Context. If
   unknown, run `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, falling
   back to `main`, then `master`. Confirm with the user if still ambiguous (e.g.
   the branch was cut from something else).

1. **Read the full branch diff** against the base:

   ```bash
   base=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/<base>)
   git log --oneline "$base"..HEAD   # commits + intent
   git diff "$base"...HEAD           # actual hunks
   ```

   Don't rely on diffstat alone; Problem/Solution must reflect the actual hunks.
   Read commit messages for intent the diff doesn't reveal.

1. **Write the description** using the Template.

   - **Problem:** what was wrong or missing and why it matters — the observable
     symptom or gap, not the implementation. Reference the linked issue/ticket
     if any.
   - **Solution:** what the change does to fix the Problem, verifiable against
     the diff. Lead with the key change; note notable trade-offs or rejected
     alternatives.
   - Keep both tight — one short paragraph or a few bullets each. Cut filler
     ("this PR", "simply", "just"). Active voice.
   - Add `## Notes` only for testing done, a migration step, a risk, or a
     follow-up worth flagging. Omit otherwise.

1. **Draft the title:**
   - **Title = consequence/why, NOT diff mechanics.** A reviewer reading only
     the title should learn what improves without opening the PR.
     - *Reject mechanical summaries:* `update X to Y`, `add helper Z`,
       `refactor auth module`.
     - *Require consequence:* `retry transient 502s so nightly import completes`,
       `adopt X for faster completion`.
   - Keep imperative mood, concise, no trailing period.
   - Follow `~/.gitcommit` conventions (type prefix/scope) if that file exists;
     a squash merge turns this title into the commit subject.

   ```txt
   BAD:  fix(fetch): add retry wrapper to the fetch helper
   GOOD: fix(fetch): retry transient 502s so the nightly import completes
   ```

1. **Show the title and description to the user and wait for approval.** Do not
   open the PR before then.

1. **Push if needed,** then open the PR:

   - `git push -u origin <branch>` if the branch has no upstream.
   - `gh pr create --base <base> --title <title> --body-file -` piping the
     approved body via heredoc. Write paragraphs as single unwrapped lines — do
     not hard-wrap at 80 columns (see Style).
   - Open ready-for-review by default. Add `--draft` only if the user asked.

1. **Report the PR URL** from `gh`'s output.

## Template

```md
## Problem

<What's wrong or missing, and why it matters. Reference the issue/ticket
if there is one.>

## Solution

<What the change does to fix it, verifiable against the diff. Lead with
the key change; note trade-offs.>

## Notes

<Optional: testing, migration steps, risks, follow-ups. Omit if empty.>
```

## Style

- Omit needless words — see
  [`../shared/CONCISE-PROSE.md`](../shared/CONCISE-PROSE.md). No marketing tone,
  no restating the diff line by line, no boilerplate checklists.
- **Don't hard-wrap the PR body.** GitHub soft-wraps prose, so manual breaks at
  80 columns render as ragged text. Write each paragraph as one continuous line;
  use real blank lines between paragraphs and list items for structure. (The
  80-column markdown convention applies to source files, not text submitted to
  GitHub.)
- Use backticks for identifiers, paths, flags, env vars.
- Describe behaviour and intent, not a file-by-file walkthrough.
- Don't invent testing or context absent from the diff or supplied by the user —
  ask instead.
- Match any PR template the repo ships (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE*`),
  mapping Problem/Solution onto its sections.
