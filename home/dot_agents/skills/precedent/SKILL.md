description: >-
  Conform work to the precedent a project already sets — naming, API shape,
  error handling, test style, document structure, terminology. Use when the
  user asks whether a change fits the codebase, when another skill needs to
  judge project conformance, or on /precedent.

# Precedent

Match work to what the project already does. The **precedent** is the pattern
the surrounding files establish — not a style guide, and not your priors. A
finding without a cited sibling is an invention.

## Boundary

An explicit convention outranks emergent precedent. Where one of these answers
the question, it is authoritative and this skill defers to it:

- Go — [`conventions-go`](../conventions-go/SKILL.md)
- Markdown — [`conventions-markdown`](../conventions-markdown/SKILL.md)
- Python — [`conventions-python`](../conventions-python/SKILL.md)
- SQL — [`conventions-sql`](../conventions-sql/SKILL.md)
- Domain terms — the nearest `CONTEXT.md` glossary

This skill owns what no guide writes down: the patterns a codebase grew.

## Input

The argument follows the skill invocation. Detect the scope:

| Argument          | Scope                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| File path or glob | Audit the given path(s) |
| `--uncommitted`   | Uncommitted changes     |
| No argument       | Ask which path to check |

For `--uncommitted`, derive the file list with `git status --porcelain`. Treat
"what I'm working on" as `--uncommitted`.

## Find the precedent

For each file in scope, locate its **peers** — the files doing the same kind of
job: siblings in the package, other implementations of the interface, other
tests of the same shape, other docs at the same level.

Two peers establish a pattern; one is a coincidence. When you find only one,
widen the search before reporting anything. When you find none, record the file
as having no precedent and move on — a first-of-its-kind file has nothing to
conform to.

## Compare

Check each file against its peers on every axis that applies. Code and
documents diverge in different ways, so work the group that fits the target.

Code:

- **Naming** — identifiers, files, test functions, packages.
- **API shape** — signatures, return types, receivers, constructor and option
  patterns.
- **Error handling** — wrapping, sentinel values, where errors surface.
- **Logging and observability** — logger, level, key names, what gets a span.
- **Structure** — where a kind of file lives, how a package is laid out, what
  goes in which file.
- **Test style** — table-driven or not, helper and fixture conventions,
  assertion style, how cases are named.
- **Dependencies** — whether the project already has a library for this.

Documents:

- **Document structure** — section names and the order they come in, heading
  depth, which sections a document of this kind carries at all.
- **Frontmatter and metadata** — which fields peers set, and the style of their
  values.
- **Presentation** — table, list, or prose for the same kind of content.
- **Terminology and voice** — the words the glossary and neighbouring docs use,
  person, mood.

Done when every file in scope has been compared against a located peer set, or
recorded as having none.

## Report

Emit the findings before changing anything. Each carries the divergence, the
precedent, and at least two citations:

```txt
1. internal/store/user.go:42 — constructor returns (*User, error);
   siblings return (User, error).
   Precedent: internal/store/order.go:31, internal/store/team.go:28
```

Rank by blast radius: patterns other code will copy first, one-off cosmetics
last.

## The outlier may be right

When the target is better than the precedent, say so and offer the inverse —
change the project to match the new code. Name the cost: how many call sites
move. Conformance is the default, not the goal; the goal is one pattern.

## Apply

Work the list with the user, one finding at a time: they take it, skip it, or
invert it. Apply each accepted fix before moving to the next, so every edit
stays steerable.

Read-only peer-finding across a large path may fan out — dispatch it to
subagents on the cheapest adequate model, then report and apply in the main
thread. See
[`../shared/SUBAGENT-STEERABILITY.md`](../shared/SUBAGENT-STEERABILITY.md).
